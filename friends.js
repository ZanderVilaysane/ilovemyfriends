I'm grateful in how you taught me by example of how to be a considerate, spontaneous friend who's (for the most part) always down for a plot. You have a heart so massive it's hung asf. I admire you for how you love and how you go about enjoying life. I'm eternally grateful for you and I'm excited to see where our friendship goes. I'm also thankful for you handling me being complain, bitch, and all of the chaos in between. Love you budbud :)",
